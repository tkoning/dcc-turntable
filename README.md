DCC control of a fleischmann turntable

Digital control of a fleischmann turntable can be achieved with an arduino nano
Turntable is controlled by means of an arduino relay board ( 5 relays neccessary)
No modification of the original turntable is needed

DCC input is by means of the standard mynabay optocoupler circuit
Manual Control is by means of a rotary encoder and an LCD display

For indexing of the fleischmann turntable a power sensing circuit is used
A seperate relais can be used to "flip" the polarity of the turntable brige

code is annotated in dutch

the turntabe can be seen on youtube
